            <p>When you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of
                cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the
                site work as you expect it to. Usually, the information does not identify you directly, but it can give you
                a more personalized web experience.</p>
            <p>The following types of cookies may be used on our website:</p>

            <p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong></p>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are
                usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting
                your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you
                about these cookies, but some parts of the site will then not work. These cookies do not store any
                personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p><strong>Tracking cookies</strong></p>
            <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of
                our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the
                site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these
                cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.</p>

            <p><strong>Targeting and advertising cookies</strong></p>
            <p>Targeting cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They can be used by these third
                parties to build a profile of your interests based on the browsing information they collect from you, which
                includes uniquely identifying your browser and terminal equipment. If you do not allow these cookies you
                will still see basic advertising on your browser that is generic and not based on your interests.</p>
